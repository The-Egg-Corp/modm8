# modm8
Lightweight and intuitive mod manager with support for [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io) and [Nexus Mods](https://nexusmods.com).

Built with [Wails](https://wails.io) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) for an Electron-like experience but without the bloat.\
These bring the following benefits:
- Go as the backend for concurrency and responsiveness.
- No browser bundled, uses native browser to render content.
- Familiar frontend. Similar to existing apps like `r2modman`.

## Features
- Multiple themes + dark mode by default.
- App settings can be easily changed. No need to go through unnecessary menus.
- Includes handy features for mod developers. (Publishing, validation etc.)
