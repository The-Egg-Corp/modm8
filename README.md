Lightweight and intuitive mod manager with support for [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io) and [Nexus Mods](https://nexusmods.com).\
Built with [Wails](https://wails.io) for an Electron-like experience but without the bloat.

> This project is heavily a WIP and as such, missing functionality or bugs will be commonplace until there is a stable release.
> 
> Once officially released, a proper FOSS license will be added and contributions will be welcome!\
> Meanwhile, there is no license, meaning all rights are reserved.
