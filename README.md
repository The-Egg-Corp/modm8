A mod manager for the modern age. Fast âœ… Intuitive âœ… Ad-free âœ… Multiple languages âœ…\
Built with [Wails](https://wails.io) for an Electron-like experience but without the bloat.

> This project is heavily **WIP** and as such, missing functionality or bugs will be commonplace until there is a stable release.
> Once officially released, a proper FOSS license will be added. Meanwhile, there is no license, meaning all rights are reserved.
